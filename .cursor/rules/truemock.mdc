1. Don't Update table model files in models folder. These are auto-generated files, and shouldn't be updated directly. For any issues in them, update the model_generator.py file. 

2. For hard-coded configs, put it in config.json file, and read it from there. 

3. Use existing code like database_connectors, columns, base_table, relations etc before generating new code. 

4. Make sure all the imports are correctly done.
